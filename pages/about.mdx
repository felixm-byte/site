# Themes

Code for Impact is focused on, well, impact. We'll encourage you to explore the best way to make a difference in the world, by teaching you how to identify an area to work on and quantify the potential impact of your solution, before letting you use your coding skill (or gain some more skills in our workshops) to create a project that has a real impact.

## Cause Areas
Researchers, from organisations like 80,000 Hours, have consistently found that these areas are the most impactful that you can work on. You don't have to work on one of these areas to have a successful project or have an impact (it's often better to focus on an area you have expertise in), but this list is a good start if you can't come up with anything.

## Climate Change

Climate Change is one of the largest risks affecting humanity, so you can make a difference by working on a project that works to address it.  It may seem like a hard thing, but remember, the small things count! Ship projects that count someone's carbon emissions, or tell you the truth about each state's pollution regulations.

## AI Safety

Artificial Intelligence is one of the most promising technologies... ever! But, it also presents many risks to humanity, from Terminator-esque events to more sophisticated dangers. Through your project, you could demonstrate how AI can be used safely, highlight its risks (like with a game), or work to mitigate some of the dangers.

## Do what matters to *you*

A major aim of Code for Impact is to help you to understand how you can make an impact, so, while we'll help you to choose an impactful cause area, it'll be up to you to make the final call! You can do the most good by working on something you have a personal edge at, so we'll encourage you to focus on this, enabling you to choose the area you can do the most good in.

# We can achieve good together.

Code for **Impact** is laser-focused on advancing your ability to do good and have a positive impact on our local and global community. Together, the young programming community can be a powerful force for good! 

Students of all skill levels will assemble for a weekend of collaboration and innovation, each building apps/websites/games that create a positive impact, and have a great time! Then, participants and judges will select the winning projects and teams.

# Coding is a valuable skill!

With code, you can create something awesome: like a website, app, game or something else. It's a modern form of self-expression, a great career path and programming is a talent that can enable you to make a difference. Gaining practise in a competitive environment like a hackathon will help you to code rapidly and collaboratively, which are valuable skills in their own right.
