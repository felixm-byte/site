# Themes

Code for Impact is focused on, well, impact. We'll encourage you to explore the best way to make a difference in the world, by teaching you how to identify an area to work on and quantify the potential impact of your solution, before letting you use your coding skill (or gain some more skills in our workshops) to create a project that has a real impact.

## Cause Areas
Researchers, from organisations like 80,000 Hours, have consistently found that these areas are the most impactful that you can work on. You don't have to work on one of these areas to have a successful project or have an impact (it's often better to focus on an area you have expertise in), but this list is a good start if you can't come up with anything.

## Climate Change

Climate Change is one of the largest risks affecting humanity, so you can make a difference by working on a project that works to address it.  It may seem like a hard thing, but remember, the small things count! Ship projects that count someone's carbon emissions, or tell you the truth about each state's pollution regulations.

## Education

A major goal of AngelHacks is to improve education—especially in computer science. Your project can help achieve this goal! Make a project that encourages students to make a mini-site, help teachers grade homework, create an online notes sharing pod, and more! We want you make a feasible project that can have a real impact on the community and beyond.

# We’re driven by a mission.

AngelHacks is dedicated in encourage students to learn computer science—at just the age where they're interested in technology and programming.

100+ students of all skill levels will assemble for a weekend of collaboration and innovation, each building apps/websites/games that give back to the community in 12 hours. Then participants and judges will select the winning projects and teams.

# Coding is a superpower.

Starting to code has a lasting impact. Once you begin coding, you switch from being a consumer to being a creator. We want to make everyone a creator—it’s a magical transformation. You can solve problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

We know this because we’re the leaders of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) at Ad Astra School, where we have good infrastructure for students to learn to code. Now, we want to bring that experience to everyone. This is a hackathon by the students, for the students, and for the future of all of Los Angeles.
