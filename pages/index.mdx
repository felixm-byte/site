**Hack for Tomorrow takes place online across 2 days.**
You’ll start by learning about how to create a potentially impactful idea, through virtual workshops and resources, on the first day.
Then, on the second day, you'll get to bring your idea, which could be an app, game or something else entirely, to life with code.
**You’ll create something awesome, and the best entries will win prizes!**

## FAQ

<Callout sx={{ mx: [null, null, -3, -4] }}>
<FAQ>

- **How much does it cost to enter?**
  Nothing! Registration is free, with prizes hopefully available

- **Who can participate? 🔭**
  Any current student grades 6–12. If you’re under/over that age, [email us](mailto:hello@angelhacks.org) & we’ll see what we can do. And if you're interested in mentoring or helping out, hit us up too!

- **Hacking‽ Is that safe? 👨🏿‍💻**
  No, we’re not “hacking” servers. The word is being constructively redefined for coding—apps, games, websites. It’s safe, supervised, & entirely educational. Now go look somewhere else, RSA.

- **What can I make? 🤖**
  Anything! A website, app, game, hardware hack, you name it. Judges will rate projects on creativity, technical skill demonstrated, polish, utility, and, last but not least, impact on the community.

- **What if I’m new to coding? 👾**
  At AngelHacks, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! Learn as you go with our intro workshops & mentors.

- **Do I need a team? 👨‍👧‍👧**
  Nope! You’ll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4—find some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.

- **What should I bring? 🧳**
  Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, anything for your hack (e.g. hardware), and enthusiasm! We'll provide snacks and meals, so you don't have to worry about that!

- **Who runs this? Is it supervised? 👨‍🏫**
  We’re independently-organized by high schoolers, mostly from Ad Astra Hack Club, sponsored via a nonprofit called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). It’s fully supervised with 20+ adult mentors & chaperones.
