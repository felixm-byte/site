**Code for Impact takes place online across 2 days.**
You‚Äôll start by learning about how to create a potentially impactful idea, through virtual workshops and resources, on the first day.
Then, on the second day, you'll get to bring your idea, which could be an app, game or something else entirely, to life with code.
**You‚Äôll create something awesome, and the best entries will win prizes!**
